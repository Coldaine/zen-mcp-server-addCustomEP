# Switching from API Key-Based Integration to Gemini CLI Substitution

Based on your setup—likely a Linux environment like Nobara with Wayland and a terminal like Ghostty—replacing an API key-driven call (e.g., to a model like Gemini via HTTP) with a subprocess invocation of the Gemini CLI tool is feasible for headless operation. This assumes you're using something like the official Google Gemini CLI or a similar wrapper (e.g., from GitHub repos you've explored). The goal is to make non-interactive calls, avoiding the interactive issues you've debugged before (e.g., arrow keys, Enter not registering, backspace problems).

## Step-by-Step Changes and Considerations

1. **Remove API Key Management**
   - Change: Eliminate all code handling API keys, authentication tokens, or HTTP headers. The CLI typically assumes authentication is pre-configured (e.g., via gcloud auth for Google's tools or environment variables in wrappers).
   - Considerations: If your app previously refreshed tokens or handled rate limits via API keys, you'll lose that granularity. CLI tools often rely on system-level auth, so ensure it's set up globally (e.g., run gcloud auth application-default login once).
   - Worry: No per-call auth customization. If the CLI requires a key, you might need to set it as an env var (e.g., export GEMINI_API_KEY=yourkey), but this is less secure in a shared app.

2. **Replace HTTP Requests with Subprocess Calls**
   - Change: Swap out libraries like requests or API clients for subprocess invocation. For example, in Python:
     ```python
     import subprocess

     # Old API way (simplified)
     # response = requests.post('https://api.example.com/generate', json={'prompt': 'Hello'}, headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_KEY'})

     # New CLI substitution
     prompt = "Hello"
     command = ["gemini", "--headless", "--prompt", prompt]  # Adjust flags based on your CLI version
     result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True)
     output = result.stdout
     ```
   - Considerations: Command construction: Build the full command string dynamically. Test it in your terminal first to ensure it works headless.
   - Environment: Run this in a non-interactive shell. If your app is GUI-based (e.g., KDE Plasma), ensure the subprocess inherits the correct env vars for Wayland/Ghostty compatibility.
   - Worry: Subprocess can fail if the CLI isn't in PATH or installed. Add checks (e.g., which gemini) and handle installation prompts in your app.

3. **Add Flags for Headless/Non-Interactive Operation**
   - Change: Append flags to make the CLI run without prompting for input. Based on common Gemini CLI implementations (e.g., forks you've looked at), use options like:
     - --non-interactive or --headless (if available) to skip menus and run in batch mode.
     - --prompt "your text here" or pipe input via stdin (e.g., echo "Hello" | gemini --model gemini-1.5-pro).
     - --output json for structured responses (easier parsing).
     - --model gemini-1.5-flash to specify the model non-interactively (avoids mid-session change issues).
   - Example full command: gemini --non-interactive --model gemini-1.5-pro --output json --prompt "Your query here".
   - Considerations: Flag availability: Not all CLI versions support true headless mode—some are inherently interactive. If yours lacks
