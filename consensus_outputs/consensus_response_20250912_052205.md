**Status:** success

> <think>
> Okay, the user is asking for expert consensus on whether to implement OAuth2 or stick with simple session-based authentication. Let me start by breaking down the key points.
> 
> First, OAuth2's benefits are security, scalability, and industry standards. I need to assess technical feasibility. OAuth2 is a standard, so it's secure and scalable. But does it require significant infrastructure? Maybe, but it's manageable. Session-based auth is simpler, but it's less secure and might face scalability issues. Need to check dependencies and current tech stack.
> 
> Next, project suitability. OAuth2 aligns with industry standards, which is good. But session-based auth is also a standard, so maybe both are viable. Compatibility with existing systems depends on the current architecture. If the project is already using OAuth2, sticking with it would be better. Otherwise, session-based might be more straightforward.
> 
> User value assessment: OAuth2 offers security and industry standards, which are benefits. Session-based is simpler but less secure. Need to compare the two. If the user value is high, OAuth2 is better. If session-based is the main concern, then sticking with it.
> 
> Implementation complexity: OAuth2 requires integration with existing systems, which might be a challenge. Session-based is easier but less secure. Risks include potential issues with existing infrastructure.
> 
> Alternatives: Maybe simpler approaches like using a single sign-in or a different protocol. Should consider if there's a simpler solution.
> 
> Industry perspective: Both OAuth2 and session-based are standards. Need to mention current best practices and any cautionary tales.
> 
> Long-term implications: Maintenance and scalability are important. If the project is scalable, OAuth2 is better. If session-based is the main concern, then it's more suitable.

> 
> Implementation complexity. OAuth2 has more complexity, requiring more code and setup. Session-based auth is simpler but might have less flexibility. The agent should highlight the risks involved.
> 
> Alternative approaches. The user might consider simpler alternatives, like using a third-party service. I should suggest that and explain the trade-offs.
